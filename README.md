# Time Series Sales Prediction Model

A machine learning project designed to predict business monthly sales using time series analysis. This model accurately forecasts future sales based on historical data patterns.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Time Series Analysis**: Utilizes advanced time series techniques to predict monthly sales
- **Data Preprocessing**: Studies trend patterns and implements lag features for feature engineering
- **Accurate Forecasting**: Predicts future 12-month sales for restaurant businesses
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses cross-validation for robust performance assessment

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

### Core Components
- **Data Preprocessing**: Trend analysis and pattern recognition
- **Feature Engineering**: Lag features implementation
- **Time Series Model**: Machine learning model for sales prediction
- **Validation**: Cross-validation techniques for model evaluation

### Algorithms & Techniques
